# I am an Operations Researcher, I solve problems.


Analytics enthusiast with a focus on Mathematical Optimization. Experience in Decision and Data Science for retail pricing and revenue management, energy and manufacturing.

Beyond work, I gave a few talks on Operations Research/Mathematical Optimization at various Data Science Meetups and workshops.
